# Fruit Prompt Generator (Template-Based)

Generates cinematic prompts for a list of fruits using template-based enhancements (no OpenAI credits required).

## How it works
- Replaces "carrot" with each fruit from the list.
- Adds cinematic, photorealistic, and ultra-detailed enhancements.
- Saves all prompts in a single file: `generated_prompts.txt`.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm start
